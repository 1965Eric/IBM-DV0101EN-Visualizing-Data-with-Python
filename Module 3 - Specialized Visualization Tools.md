What do the letters in the box plot above represent?

- A. [ ] A = Mean, B = Upper Mean Quartile, C = Lower Mean Quartile, D = Inter Quartile Range, E = Minimum, and F = Outliers
- B. [ ] A = Mean, B = Third Quartile, C = First Quartile, D = Inter Quartile Range, E = Minimum, and F = Outliers
- C. [X] A = Median, B = Third Quartile, C = First Quartile, D = Inter Quartile Range, E = Minimum, and F = Outliers
- D. [ ] A = Median, B = Third Quartile, C = Mean, D = Inter Quartile Range, E = Lower Quartile, and F = Outliers
- E. [ ] A = Mean, B = Third Quartile, C = First Quartile, D = Inter Quartile Range, E = Minimum, and F = Maximum

Question 2: What is the correct combination of function and parameter to create a box plot in Matplotlib?

- A. [ ] Function = box, and Parameter = type, with value = "plot"
- B. [ ] Function = boxplot, and Parameter = type, with value = "plot"
- C. [ ] Function = plot, and Parameter = type, with value = "box"
- D. [ ] Function = plot, and Parameter = kind, with value = "boxplot"
- E. [X] Function = plot, and Parameter = kind, with value = "box"
