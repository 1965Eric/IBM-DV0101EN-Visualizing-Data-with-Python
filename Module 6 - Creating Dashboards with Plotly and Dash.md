## Module Introduction

In this module, you will get started with dashboard creation using the Plotly library.  You will create a dashboard with the theme "US Domestic Airline Flights Performance". You will do this using a US airline reporting carrier on-time performance dataset, Plotly, and Dash concepts learned throughout the course. Hands-on labs will follow each concept to make you comfortable with using the library. Reading lists will reference additional resources to learn more about the concepts covered. 

## Learning Objectives

* Identify high-level popular Python dashboarding tools.
* Demonstrate basic Plotly, Plotly.graph_objects, and Plotly express commands.
* Demonstrate using Dash and basic Dash components (core and HTML).
* Demonstrate adding different dashboard elements including text boxes, dropdowns, graphs, and others.
* Apply interactivity to dash core and HTML components.
* Describe how a dashboard can be used to answer critical business questions.
