## Module Introduction

In this module, you will get started with dashboard creation using the Plotly library.  You will create a dashboard with the theme "US Domestic Airline Flights Performance". You will do this using a US airline reporting carrier on-time performance dataset, Plotly, and Dash concepts learned throughout the course. Hands-on labs will follow each concept to make you comfortable with using the library. Reading lists will reference additional resources to learn more about the concepts covered. 

## Learning Objectives

* Identify high-level popular Python dashboarding tools.
* Demonstrate basic Plotly, Plotly.graph_objects, and Plotly express commands.
* Demonstrate using Dash and basic Dash components (core and HTML).
* Demonstrate adding different dashboard elements including text boxes, dropdowns, graphs, and others.
* Apply interactivity to dash core and HTML components.
* Describe how a dashboard can be used to answer critical business questions.

## Reading: Summary

* Best dashboards answer critical business questions. It will help businesses make informed decisions, thereby improving performance. 
* Dashboards can produce real-time visuals. 
* Plotly is an interactive, open-source plotting library that supports over 40 chart types. 
* The web-based visualizations created using Plotly python can be displayed in Jupyter notebook, saved to standalone HTML files, or served as part of pure Python-built web applications using Dash. 
* Plotly Graph Objects is the low-level interface to figures, traces, and layout whereas Plotly express is a high-level wrapper for Plotly. 
* Dash is an Open-Source User Interface Python library for creating reactive, web-based applications. It is both enterprise-ready and a first-class member of Plotlyâ€™s open-source tools. 
* Core and HTML are the two components of Dash. 
* The dash_html_components library has a component for every HTML tag. 
* The dash_core_components describe higher-level components that are interactive and are generated with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through the React.js library. 
* A callback function is a python function that is automatically called by Dash whenever an input component's property changes. Callback function is decorated with $@app.callback$ decorator. 
* Callback decorator function takes two parameters: Input and Output. Input and Output to the callback function will have component id and component property. Multiple inputs or outputs should be enclosed inside either a list or tuple.
