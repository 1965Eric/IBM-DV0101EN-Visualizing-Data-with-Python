## Learning Objectives

In this lesson you will learn about:

* Folium, a data visualization library in Python.
* Creating maps of different regions of the world and how to superimpose markers on top of a map.
* Creating Choropleth maps with Folium.

## Graded Quiz

Question 1: If you are interested in generating a map of Spain to visualize its hill shading and natural vegetation, which of the following lines of code will create the right map for you? (Try and code yourself before answering this question.)

- A. [ ] ```folium.Map(location=[40.4637, 3.7492], zoom_start=6, tiles='Stamen Terrain')```
- B. [ ] ```folium.Map(location=[40.4637, 3.7492], zoom_start=6)```
- C. [X] ```folium.Map(location=[40.4637, -3.7492], zoom_start=6, tiles='Stamen Terrain')```
- D. [ ] ```folium.Map(location=[40.4637, 3.7492], zoom_start=6, tiles='Stamen Toner')```
- E. [ ] ```folium.Map(location=[-40.4637, -3.7492], zoom_start=6, tiles='Stamen Toner')```

Question 2: You cluster markers superimposed onto a map in Folium using a *feature group* object.

- A. [X] False
- B. [ ] True

Question 3: A choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map.

- A. [X] True
- B. [ ] False
